## Refresh Token

This project was made as an studying practice to implements refresh token on a nodeJs back-end application.

This application uses NodeJs with Express.
As database this uses PostgreSQL and PrismaJS as ORM.

To use this application:
1) run "yarn" on terminal to install the node modules.
2) run "yarn prisma migrate dev" on terminal to create the migrations (enter .env file to configurate the string connection to yours PostgreSQL database).
3) run "yarn dev" to run the server.

I`ve use Insomnia for testing the routes.
